# ITCS 4102 Final Project Coding Examples
### By Zachary "Xander" Bruce

## Description:

- This Git repository contains most of the coding examples mentioned in my accompanying paper.

- *PASCAL AND ALGOL 68 CODE IS NOT WRITTEN BY ME* they are written by Feuer and Gehani, and Chris Hermansen, respectively and are sourced both in the paper and in the this readme in the references section.

- Other code used in the paper I source in both the paper and at the bottom of this readme

- All coded examples that are not Images are written by me

## Steps to run code:

- Every single coded example by me has instructions for running the code in a comment at the top of a file
