# ITCS 4102 Final Project Coding Examples
### By Zachary "Xander" Bruce

## Description:

- This Git repository contains most of the coding examples mentioned in my accompanying paper.

> - *PASCAL AND ALGOL 68 CODE IS NOT WRITTEN BY ME* they are written by Feuer and Gehani, and Chris Hermansen, respectively and are sourced both in the paper and in the this readme in the references section.

- Other code used in the paper I source in both the paper and at the bottom of this readme.

- All coded examples that are not Images are written by me.

## Steps to run code:

- Every single coded example by me has instructions for running the code in a comment at the top of a file.
- Code Examples not written by me do not have instructions for running the code included within this repository, the Algol 68 code does have instructions for downloading a Algol 68 compiler on the article by Chris Hermansen![https://opensource.com/article/20/12/learn-algol-68].
- The Pascal code is the only code that does not have instructions for downloading a compiler and running the code. I did not have time to try and find the correct compiler for running that code, and I am not familiar with the changes to Pascal over it's existence and would not know how exactly to adapt that code to more modern Pascal coventions. I think this would also defeat the purpose of trying to show the code how it once was represented and practiced at a certain point in the past. So I decided not to adapt the code and simply show it as an image in both the paper and this repository.
